# The 3 Day Countdown
Well one of the most overlooked areas when it comes to maximizing proficiency comes down to data management. I started out this website/blog in order to keep a timeline for my career progress as I learn more about computer science.

I have a very cluttered email address box, I also have 2 million windows open on my personal computer. Simply put it was hindering my ability to do alot of stuff cheif amongst which was not being able to track my internship applications from diffrent companies. 

>So I had to come up with something that would drastically change my workflow. I decided to deloy what I call **Clean Wipe Initiative**

## Clean Wipe Initiative? What in the world is that??

Well in simple terms it just means to get all my online accounts back to their ship-shape and bristol fashion state from before I had the audacity to sign up for every online mailing list I can put my hand on ðŸ« 

So in that regard not much in terms of updates, The website is still under construction so it will get better as I learn more. I recently added a function to my blog for future suggestions along with the search tag function which I will oversee for next publication!
