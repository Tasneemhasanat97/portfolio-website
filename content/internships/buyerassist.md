### Description

- Developed an event-driven integration framework using **AWS AppFlows,** **Lambda** functions and **EventBridge** to sync customer data between the **BuyerAssist** platform and **Salesforce CRM**. Through this, I learned to build systems to support bi-directional sync of large volumes of data from multiple sources, perform **CRUD** operations on **MongoDB** as well as schema design.
- Developed a **Slack bot** to send customers daily notifications on their tasks and action plans. These messages are interactive, allowing users to take actions directly from Slack. To drive the automation further, I implemented **Slash Commands** to trigger complex workflows in BuyerAssist, just by typing a simple command in the Slack application.

These automations and integrations proved to eliminate the initial resistance, therefore significantly increasing the adoption of BuyerAssist platform among our clients.
